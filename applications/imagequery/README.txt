In this image query app, container1 should send the resized picture to container2 for to generate captions. However, as we are using simplerpc, we are not able to transport picture between containers. Thus, for simplicity, when testing with simplerpc, the resized picture generated in container1 is stored at path /container/resized_image_name.jpg, and we make a copy(in /container/im2txt/data/images/resized_image_name.jpg) into the container2 when buildig the image.
